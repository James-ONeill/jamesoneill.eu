            Hi, I'm James O'Neill.<br>

                I live and work near Bristol and specialise in Laravel, JavaScript including Vue &amp; React, and CSS. I 
                also have a series of live screencasts on  
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCf1sLqo_rGEsS7hivNN_5A">Tailwind CSS</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is my personal website and a place for me to share what Iâ€™m working on or thinking about, both in 
                the world of programming and in my other interests.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're reading this I would love to hear from you. If you're stuck on something I might be able to 
                help and if you're not then it would still be interesting to hear what you're working on and learn about 
                you. If you'd like to get in touch you can email me at james @ this domain (or any other domain I own) 
                or you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesoneill83">Twitter (@jamesoneill83)</a>. If you 
                are near bristol then I would absolutely love to get coffee sometime.
