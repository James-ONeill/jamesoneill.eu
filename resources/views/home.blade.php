            Hi, I'm James O'Neill.<br>
            I'm a software developer.

            <p>
                I mainly work on the web and specialise in Laravel and
                React but I’m interested in all aspects of modern
                software development and always interested in improving
                my skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you like what you’ve read on my site and want to chat
                then I’d love to hear from you. You could drop me an
                email at james@jamesoneill.eu or send a tweet to
                <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesoneill83">@jamesoneill83</a>.
                If you’re in Bristol and want to talk then it would be
                great to grab coffee some time.
