                I mainly work on the web and specialise in Laravel and
                React but I’m interested in all aspects of modern
                software development and always interested in improving
                my skills.

                If you like what you’ve read on my site and want to chat
                then I’d love to hear from you. You could drop me an
                email at james@jamesoneill.eu or send a tweet to
                <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesoneill83">@jamesoneill83</a>.
                If you’re in Bristol and want to talk then it would be
                great to grab coffee some time.
