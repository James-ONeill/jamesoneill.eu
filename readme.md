## About jamesoneill.eu

This is the source code for my personal website and blog, which can be found at
[jamesoneill.eu](https://jamesoneill.eu). The site is built using Laravel, with
all the posts available in Markdown in the `/resources/posts` directory.

At the time of writing the site is a work in progress that I am gradually
chipping away at. It is currently 30 March 2017 and I have just published my
first post. Hopefully there will be many more to come.
